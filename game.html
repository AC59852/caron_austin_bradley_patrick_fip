		<p class="mechanicsText">PKM BattleArena is an arena styled game mode. This means that the length of the game is contained in a large map, with an arena in the middle, where players are forced into every 5 minutes to battle against each other. There are two teams, red and blue. Each team consists of 6 players, who all choose their Pokemon before the game begins. Pokemon are picked from what are called "Taverns" and each have different types based on their types/roles within their real game. Once everyone chooses their Pokemon, players are given 30 seconds to buy their starting items before being thrown into the arena. These are called duels and occur every 5 minutes after the first. The winning team will always receive a gold reward for each player on the team. Players will then leave their base, and go out into the world, fighting hostile Pokemon, gaining EXP, leveling up and facing greater challenges, all while earning gold and buying powerful items.</p>

		<h1 class="contentHeader2">The Map</h1>
		<p class="mapText">Blending Pokemon with Warcraft III is not an easy challenge, but we are dedicated to crafting a hand made map that feels familiar, but with tons to discover at every turn. Mixing pieces from Generation One's Kanto Region map, and style pieces from Warcraft III and general game design, the map gives off the sense that you are in the world of Pokemon. Designated bases for each team with shops allows for a simple start point, an easy place to regroup, puchase basic but much needed items and so much more. Areas on the map are designed for defeating hostile NPC's with and without interference with the enemy team. Areas for shops within the map give access to much more powerful weapons, at the cost of more gold to spend, and less ease of access to get there, as it is out in the open world, your enemies can easily walk up and attack you at a moments notice. The center arena is not just for battling oonents, but large, strong and rewarding enemies will appear, giving a team to claim the kill and collect incredible loot. Two pathways lead to shops with the most powerful purchasable in the game, with one having more hostile NPC's making enemies avoid it, or one with less NPC's, enticing an easier, but more PVP oriented route. Experience our love and care into making this map, and get a hit of nostalgia whilst crushing your enemies in the Kanto Region!</p>
