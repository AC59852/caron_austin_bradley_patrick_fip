		<p class="austinText">Hi there. I am Austin Caron, creator, lead developer, and the person that came up with this idea. I have loved the Warcraft games for so long, remembering my earliest memories dating back to World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, when I was a child as a substitute for a baby sitter. I got into Warcraft 3 around 2013, to primarily play with friends. I had played through the campaign and loved every minute of it, then I had learned of custom games, and took a glimpse of a bigger world. Tree Tag, Troll and Elves, Angel Arena, and so many more I would play hours of with friends. Recently, we came across a Pokemon styled Angel Arena, and while it had a ton of issues, it was incredibly fun, and the concept was amazing. The mode hasn’t been updated in years, so I had figured I would do it justice, and fix all the problems, and provide a better player experience in the process. Here we are now, developing a mode with intricate detail and loving every minute of it. I really hope you enjoy the game when it comes out, and expect tons of updates following its release!</p>

		<p class="londonText">Our current living space and development hub for PKM BattleArena. Studying at Fanshawe College, being given the opportunity to create masterful pieces such as this site, surrounded by the best of the best local, national and international development teams for web design in Downtown London. Following in the footsteps of creative, informative, understanding and fair teachers, we have been able to put our heart and soul into this project more so than any, partially due to where we are located, and the people around us. We have been given a great opportunity and plan to run with it. We sincerely appreciate the time we spend in our Downtown campus, and have zero intention of letting any knowledge learned, go to waste.</p>
