		<p class="mechanicsText">PKM BattleArena is an arena styled game mode. This means that the length of the game is contained in a large map, with an arena in the middle, where players are forced into every 5 minutes to battle against each other. There are two teams, red and blue. Each team consists of 6 players, who all choose their Pokemon before the game begins. Pokemon are picked from what are called "Taverns" and each have different types based on their types/roles within their real game. Once everyone chooses their Pokemon, players are given 30 seconds to buy their starting items before being thrown into the arena. These are called duels and occur every 5 minutes after the first. The winning team will always receive a gold reward for each player on the team. Players will then leave their base, and go out into the world, fighting hostile Pokemon, gaining EXP, leveling up and facing greater challenges, all while earning gold and buying powerful items.</p>

Team up with 5 other friends, and take on 6 people in a PVE/PVP clash to see which team has the better Pokemon Trainers. Pick your favorite Pokemon from the first generation, level up, obtain powerful items, defeat incredible legendary Pokemon and maybe use one yourself.
